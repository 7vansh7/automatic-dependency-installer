# automatic-dependency-installer
This is a bash script which installs all the required dependencies and packages in a project


Currently the script only works for python/pip and javascript/node projects and works only on Unix based systems except some outliers

Just clone the script in the project root and run the following two commands --

sudo chmod script.sh 777

sudo ./script.sh || sudo bash script.sh
